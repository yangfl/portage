Title: Debian io Manual
Author: Io Language Team <iolanguage@yahoogroups.com>
Abstract: The ideas in Io are mostly inspired by Smalltalk (all values are
 objects), Self (prototype-based), NewtonScript (differential inheritance),
 Act1 (actors and futures for concurrency), LISP (code is a runtime
 inspectable/modifiable tree) and Lua (small, embeddable).
